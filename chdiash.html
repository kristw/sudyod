  </font> </b> </font><font color="#3399FF" size="4"> <br>
  <font color="#FF6666">Abandoned Shrine:<br>
  Go for it, +2 dex, no penalty. Creepy Shrine: Go for it, +2 str, no penalty. 
  </font></font> 
</center>
<p><font color="#FF6666" size="4"> Cryptic: <br>
  Full mana ball, useful. If you're surrounded in a corridor and you have telekinesis, 
  you can also wipe out a ton of enemies that way from the Nova. </font>
<p><font color="#FF6666" size="4"> Divine: <br>
  Gives you free potions, use it :) </font>
<p><font color="#FF6666" size="4"> Eerie: <br>
  Despite the message, it's +2 to Magic with no penalities. </font>
<p><font color="#FF6666" size="4"> Eldritch: <br>
  Before using it, go to town and buy as many regular/full healing potions as 
  you can. Then use the shrine. They'll all become Rejuvenation potions. If you 
  don't want to use them, you can sell them for 70 gold profit on the regular, 
  and 100 (I think) gold profit on the fulls. </font>
<p><font color="#FF6666" size="4"> Enchanted:<br>
  Unless you've only got one or two spells, use it. It's easy to recover one spell 
  level for one particular spell, it's hard to gain a level for 10+ spells. Very 
  nice for Sorcerers and Rogues. </font>
<p><font color="#FF6666" size="4"> Fascinating Shrine: <br>
  Avoid like the Plague. The +2 spell level isn't worth the permanent Mana loss. 
  </font>
<p><font color="#FF6666" size="4"> Glimmering Shrine: <br>
  Use, but beforehand, have everyone in your party give all their unidentified 
  equipment to you. </font>
<p><font color="#FF6666" size="4"> Gloomy: <br>
  Have everyone give you their armor, but drop all weapons before use. </font>
<p><font color="#FF6666" size="4"> Hidden: <br>
  Unless you've got very low durability equipment you don't want to accidentally 
  weaken, use it. Also, if you want to make a specific item stronger, drop everything 
  but that item and a generic item found on the floor. 50/50 chance you'll get 
  lucky (very useful with a Thinking Cap). </font>
<p><font color="#FF6666" size="4"> Holy: <br>
  Your choice, it really doesn't matter (it's only like casting phasing). </font>
<p><font color="#FF6666" size="4"> Magical: <br>
  </font><font color="#3399FF" size="4"> <font color="#FF6666">If you're a warrior 
  or a rogue with low magic, it may not be worth it. If you're a high level Rogue 
  or Sorcerer, go for it. </font></font>
<p><font color="#3399FF" size="4"> Mysterious: <br>
  It's your choice. Personally, I avoid all the shrines that lower stats, even 
  if they do raise one or more. </font>
<p><font color="#3399FF" size="4"> Ornate: <br>
  Avoid. Holy Bolt's easy enough to raise levels, but the mana loss is permanent. 
  </font>
<p><font color="#3399FF" size="4"> Quiet: <br>
  Unless someone else in your party needs it badly, use it. +2 to vitality, no 
  penalities. </font>
<p><font color="#3399FF" size="4"> Religious: <br>
  Before using it, have everyone give you their weapons to repair. </font>
<p><font color="#3399FF" size="4"> Sacred: <br>
  Avoid as well, as the spell levels aren't worth the mana loss. </font>
<p><font color="#3399FF" size="4"> Secluded: <br>
  Sure, a full map's always worth having (even if you can't tell where you haven't 
  been yet anymore). </font>
<p><font color="#3399FF" size="4"> Spiritual: <br>
  If you're low on money, empty your pockets before using. If you're rich enough, 
  you can just ignore it (it's usually only around 700 gold). </font>
<p><font color="#3399FF" size="4"> Spooky: <br>
  If you can, have someone else use the shrine so you get potions ;) Always worth 
  using. </font>
<p><font color="#3399FF" size="4"> Stone: <br>
  Useless unless you have staves. If more than one person has them, empty the 
  staff before using, and give all of them to one person, who uses the shrine. 
  </font>
<p><font color="#3399FF" size="4"> Tainted: <br>
  From my experience, people hate it when their stats change without their prior 
  approval, and this shrine'll do that. Ask before using (I usually avoid using 
  it). </font>
<p><font color="#3399FF" size="4"> Weird: <br>
  Have everyone give the user of the shrine their weapons before using it. </font>
<p><font color="#3399FF" size="4"> Blood Fountain/Purifying Spring:<br>
  Sure, use it all you want. It's unlimited use, free Health/Mana recovery. </font>
<p><font color="#3399FF" size="4"> Fountain of Tears:<br>
  It's your choice, but I always avoid the shrines/objects that lower my stats 
  and raise others. </font>
<p><font color="#3399FF" size="4"> Goat Shrine/Cauldron:<br>
  Once again, personal choice. I think it's too risky, although 9 out of 10 times 
  I use a Goat Shrine, I got Mana Shield. Choose for yourself. </font>
